# Fn

Fn is a prototype functional programming language aiming to balance functional rigor with ease of use.

This is the third attempt at it! Check out the [Ruby](https://github.com/jonnyarnold/fn) and [Go](https://github.com/jonnyarnold/fn-go) versions!

This version is built with [Flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/), [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) and [LLVM](http://llvm.org/). The move to C is to hopefully speed up development.

## Features

None so far; I'm still working on getting things up and running!
